# Devlog Entry - [11/16/2024]

## Introducing the team
Our team is composed of dedicated members each bringing unique skills and roles:
- **Kaylee Morales (Tools Lead)**: I'll be researching and setting up tools and configurations for the team, and helping with coding style guidelines and auto-formatting systems. I'll also support source control and deployment setups.
- **Hasina (Engine Lead)**: Hasina will oversee the creative direction and possibly the engine standards, teaching the team about our chosen engine and ensuring our game's design remains consistent.
- **Celestial (Design Lead)**: Celestial will assist in setting the creative vision, contributing to art and design elements, ensuring they align with our game's objectives.
- **Shea (Assistant Tools Lead)**: Supporting tool setups and configurations, and ensuring all team members are comfortable with our development environment.
- **Samina (Assistant Engine Lead)**: Focused on engine research and integration, making code examples, and maintaining the organization of our project's codebase.

## Tools and materials
- **Engine/Platform**: Phaser Library. We think that Phaser is good for the game we plan to make, and we all have experience developing with Phaser.
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript or Typescript, as well as JSON as the data language. These languages are heavily used in the Phaser library, so these are the ones we will use. 
- **IDEs and Tools**: VScode as the IDE and potentially Aseprite to create assets. We all have experience with VScode so it would make sense to use this IDE and one member has experience with Aseprite and is willing to help other members learn as well. 
- **Alternate Platform**: As an alternative, we are considering using Unity, which would shift our primary scripting language to C# and alter our approach to handling game physics and rendering. 


## Outlook
- **Innovations**: We aim to integrate advanced NPCs that can adapt to player actions, which might be more complex than typical enemy designs.
- **Challenges**: The most challenging part will likely be ensuring smooth integration and performance optimization for different platforms.
- **Learning Goals**: We are excited to deepen our understanding of Godot and improve our proficiency in using the engine for complex game mechanics.

Feel free to adapt this file as we change our objectives/engine!
